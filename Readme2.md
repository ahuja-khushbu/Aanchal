#viva question on code
Here are some viva questions based on the provided HTML and CSS code, along with their answers:

### 1. **What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration?**
   - **Answer:** The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML used. It helps browsers render the page correctly by specifying that the document adheres to HTML5.

### 2. **Explain the significance of the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag.**
   - **Answer:** The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. UTF-8 supports all characters, including special symbols and multilingual text, ensuring proper display across different languages.

### 3. **What is the role of CSS variables (e.g., `--primary-color`) in the provided code?**
   - **Answer:** CSS variables (also known as custom properties) allow for the reuse of values throughout the stylesheet. Variables like `--primary-color` store specific values, such as colors, making it easier to maintain and modify the design consistently across the entire webpage.

### 4. **What is the use of the `box-sizing: border-box;` property in the `*` selector?**
   - **Answer:** The `box-sizing: border-box;` property ensures that padding and border are included within the element’s total width and height, rather than expanding the element’s size. It simplifies layout calculations.

### 5. **What does the `scroll-behavior: smooth;` property do in the `html` selector?**
   - **Answer:** The `scroll-behavior: smooth;` property enables smooth scrolling when users click on internal links that navigate to different sections within the same page (e.g., links with `href="#section"`).

### 6. **Explain the purpose of the `.parallax` class in the code.**
   - **Answer:** The `.parallax` class is used to create a parallax scrolling effect, where the background image stays fixed in place while the content scrolls over it. This effect enhances the visual appeal of the webpage by creating depth.

### 7. **Why is the `position: sticky;` used in the `nav` section?**
   - **Answer:** The `position: sticky;` property ensures that the navigation bar stays visible at the top of the page when the user scrolls. It remains "sticky" at the top once the user scrolls past its original position, improving navigation usability.

### 8. **What is the purpose of the `.testimonial-container` class in the testimonials section?**
   - **Answer:** The `.testimonial-container` class organizes the testimonial cards in a flexible grid-like layout using `display: flex;` and `flex-wrap: wrap;`. It ensures that the testimonials are responsive and adjust to different screen sizes.

### 9. **How does the button hover effect work in the `.btn:hover` selector?**
   - **Answer:** The `.btn:hover` selector changes the background color of the button when the user hovers over it. The `transition: background-color 0.3s ease;` ensures a smooth transition between colors, enhancing the user experience.

### 10. **What is the purpose of the `eventListener` added for anchor links in the script section?**
   - **Answer:** The JavaScript at the end of the code adds an `eventListener` to anchor (`<a>`) links that start with `#`. When these links are clicked, the default behavior is prevented, and the browser smoothly scrolls to the targeted section of the page.
