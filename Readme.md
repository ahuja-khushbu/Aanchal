### 1. **What is HTML and why is it important?**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. By utilizing tags to define elements like text, images, links, and multimedia, it ensures that web browsers render content correctly. HTML is crucial for creating interactive and accessible web experiences.

---

### 2. **Client-side and Server-side Technologies**

- **Client-side technologies** (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) handle the presentation of data to users and perform client-side validations.
- **Server-side technologies** (e.g., PHP, Python) are responsible for retrieving data from databases and processing business logic on the server before sending the response to the client.

---

### 3. **Purpose of `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration**

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML used (typically HTML5). It helps browsers understand how to properly render the web page according to the document's structure. This tag does not have a closing tag.

---

### 4. **Structure of an HTML Document**

An HTML document is structured as follows:
- `<!DOCTYPE>`: Defines the document type.
- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information like the document's title, styles, and scripts.
- `<title>`: The title shown in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content displayed on the page, such as text, images, and links.

---

### 5. **Difference Between `<div>` and `<span>` Tags**

- **`<div>`**: A block-level element used to group larger sections of content. It creates a new line and is often used to structure layouts.
- **`<span>`**: An inline element that wraps around smaller chunks of text or content within other elements without creating a new line. Useful for applying styles within text.

---

### 6. **HTML Headings and Their Usage**

HTML headings range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, where `<h1>` is the most important heading, and `<h6>` is the least. Headings are used to structure content on the page and help search engines understand the hierarchy and importance of the content.

---

### 7. **The `<img>` Tag and Its Attributes**

The `<img>` tag is used to display images in HTML. It is an empty tag (self-closing) and has important attributes:
- `src`: Specifies the URL or file path of the image.
- `alt`: Provides alternate text for the image if it cannot be displayed.
- `width` and `height`: Set the dimensions of the image in pixels.

---

### 8. **Creating Hyperlinks in HTML**

Hyperlinks allow users to navigate between web pages. They are created using the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute specifying the target URL. Example:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click Here</a>
```

---

### 9. **Different Types of Lists in HTML**

- **Ordered List (`<ol>`)**: Displays a numbered list of items in a specific order.
- **Unordered List (`<ul>`)**: Displays items in a bulleted list, without specific order.
- **Definition List (`<dl>`)**: Contains terms (`<dt>`) and their definitions (`<dd>`).

---

### 10. **Purpose of HTML Forms and Key Elements**

HTML forms are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. Important form elements include:
- `<form>`: The container for form inputs.
- `<input>`: For gathering user input (text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes).
- `<textarea>`: For multi-line text input.
- `<button>`: For submitting or resetting the form.
